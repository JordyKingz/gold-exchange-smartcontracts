# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/2_deployProxies.ts
```

### Project setup

Gold Exchange smart contracts are upgradable using the OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin. To learn more about this plugin, go to the [OpenZeppelin Upgrades documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/upgrading-smart-contracts).
